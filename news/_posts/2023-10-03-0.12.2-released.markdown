* Fixed [an issue](https://mworks.discourse.group/t/eyelink-crashes-mwserver/909/7) that caused MWServer to crash when loading an experiment that contains an [EyeLink](/documentation/0.12.2/components/eyelink_device.html) device
* Added `active_when_hidden` parameter to [rectangular](/documentation/0.12.2/components/fixation_point_stimulus.html) and [circular](/documentation/0.12.2/components/circular_fixation_point_stimulus.html) fixation points, which can be used to restore their pre-0.12 behavior when off screen
* Reduced the start-up latency of [sound](/documentation/0.12.2/components/sounds.html) playback ([more info](https://mworks.discourse.group/t/mworks-sound-issue/888)), and fixed a few issues revealed by this change
* Added support for the [LabJack T8](https://labjack.com/products/t8) to the [LabJack LJM](/documentation/0.12.2/components/labjack_ljm_device.html) interface
* [LabJack LJM](/documentation/0.12.2/components/labjack_ljm_device.html) and [EyeLink](/documentation/0.12.2/components/eyelink_device.html) interfaces now support both arm64 (Apple silicon) and x86_64 (Intel) processors

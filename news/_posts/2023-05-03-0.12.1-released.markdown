This release fixes an [issue](https://github.com/mworks/mworks-issues/issues/444) in [MWorks 0.12]({% post_url news/2023-04-12-0.12-released %}) that, in certain circumstances, caused audio playback to fail after unloading an experiment.

MWorks 0.12.1 requires a Mac running macOS Big Sur (11.0) or later or an iPad running iPadOS 16.0 or later.  It was tested on macOS 11, 12, and 13 and iPadOS 16.

## What is MWorks? ##

MWorks is a suite of [open source](https://opensource.org/) applications and libraries for designing and running realtime experiments, particularly in the domains of psychology and neurophysiology.

It provides high-level tools for specifying experimental flow, e.g. hierarchical constructs such as [blocks](/documentation/latest/components/block.html) and [trials](/documentation/latest/components/trial.html), as well as finite state machine constructs like [states](/documentation/latest/components/task_system_state.html) and [transitions](/documentation/latest/components/transitions.html).  It enables fine control over a wide range of [input and output devices](/documentation/latest/components/input_output.html), such as displays, data acquisition systems, and general purpose input/output (GPIO) devices.  In addition, for vision researchers, it includes a rich set of [visual stimuli](/documentation/latest/components/stimuli.html).

MWorks was originally created for conducting visual neurophysiology experiments, but it was designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind.

## Can I use MWorks? ##

Yes!  See the [installation guide](https://mworks.tenderapp.com/kb/installation/installing-mworks) to learn how to download and install the software, and read the [user manual](/documentation/latest/) to learn how it works.  If you need help, check out our [knowledge base](https://mworks.tenderapp.com/kb), and feel free to [contact us](https://mworks.tenderapp.com/discussion/new) with any questions.

*Please note*: While we'd like to support as many users as possible, our resources are limited.  Most of the labs currently using MWorks make significant contributions to its development, either by helping to maintain and improve the source code or by providing financial support to the development team.  If you use MWorks in your research and need ongoing support, we may ask you to contribute, too!

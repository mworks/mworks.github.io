Firmata Digital Output Pulse Channel
====================================


Description
-----------
Digital output pulse channel on a `Firmata Device`.

A digital output pulse channel triggers output "pulses" on its associated
pin.  Whenever a pulse duration is assigned to `value`_, MWorks sends a
pulse command to the Firmata device.  Upon receiving the command, the device
sets the pin to high/true.  Once the requested interval (as measured by the
device's onboard clock) has elapsed, the device sets the pin back to
low/false.

*Note*: Firmata devices require pulse durations to be specified in
milliseconds.  MWorks converts durations assigned to `value`_ from
microseconds to milliseconds before sending them to the device.



Signature
---------
``iochannel/firmata_digital_output_pulse``


Required Parameters
-------------------

pin_number
^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``4``

Output pin number

value
^^^^^

Variable from which to read pulse duration (in microseconds). 
`Assigning <Assign Variable>` a value to the variable causes the pulse
to begin immediately.

*Note*: Pulse durations must be whole numbers of milliseconds.

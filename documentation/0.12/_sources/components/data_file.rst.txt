Data File
=========


Description
-----------
By default, opening and closing of data files (aka event files) is
controlled via MWClient.  By including a data file device in your
experiment, you can transfer responsibility for data-file management to the
experiment itself.

If an experiment includes a data file device, a data file will be opened
automatically when the experiment starts running.  If a data file with the
specified `filename`_ is already open (e.g. because this is the second run
of a protocol), then the existing file remains open.  If a data file with a
different name is open, that file is closed before the new file is created.
If a data file with the specified filename already exists and is not
currently open, the existing file will *not* be overwritten.  If opening the
data file fails for this or any other reason, the experiment will not start.

While an experiment with a data file device is loaded, data files cannot be
opened or closed via MWClient.  However, the client will still
display the name of the current data file.

*Note*: An experiment can include only one data file device.  Also, `Start
IO Device`, `Stop IO Device`, and `autostart`_ have no effect on this
device.



Signature
---------
``iodevice/data_file``


Required Parameters
-------------------

filename
^^^^^^^^
:Examples: | ``my_file``
           | ``my_experiment/${subject}/run-${run_counter}``
           | ``/Volumes/Data/exp1/$(date("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"))``

Filesystem path and name for the data file, excluding the file
extension (``.mwk2``), which is appended automatically.

If the filename is a relative path (i.e. it does not begin with ``/``),
then the `standard data-file directory <Accessing the Event File>` is
prepended to it before the file is created.  Absolute paths are not
modified.

Typically, the filename will make use of `variable and/or expression
interpolation <Variable and Expression Interpolation>` to ensure that
each experimental session produces a unique data file.  The interpolated
components of the filename are re-evaluated each time the experiment
starts, so changes to variable values and expression results between
runs in a given session will result in different filenames for each run.




Optional Parameters
-------------------

autostart
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the device will start I/O automatically (as if by an
implicit `Start IO Device` action) when the experiment starts running.

*Note*: Device I/O will always stop automatically when the experiment
stops running, irrespective of this setting.


alt
^^^

Alternative device to use if this one fails to initialize (e.g. because the required hardware is not available).  If ``#allowAltFailover`` is set to 0 or false, this parameter is ignored.

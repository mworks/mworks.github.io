Stop Blackrock LED Driver
=========================

*Available on macOS*


Description
-----------
Stop a `Blackrock LED Driver`.  If the driver is not running, this action
has no effect.

*Note*: Under normal circumstances, there is no need to use this action, as
the driver will stop automatically after running for the duration specified
by `Run Blackrock LED Driver`.  An explicit stop is required only when you
want to stop the driver early, before the active run completes.

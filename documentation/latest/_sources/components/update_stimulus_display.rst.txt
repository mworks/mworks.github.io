.. _Update Stimulus Display:

Update Stimulus Display
=======================


Description
-----------
Commit pending changes to the display queue, and trigger a redraw of the
stimulus display.  On the next display refresh, any stimuli that have been
`queued <Queue Stimulus>` will be drawn, and any stimuli that have been
`dequeued <Dequeue Stimulus>` will *not* be drawn (and thus will be erased
if they were previously visible).

*Note*: Before completing, this action waits for all drawing commands to be
submitted to the graphics hardware.  However, it does *not* wait for the
actual display update to occur.  If your experiment must coordinate other
actions with the actual display update, it will need to wait until the time
provided by `predicted_output_time`_.

Optional Parameters
-------------------

predicted_output_time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Name of a variable in which to store the predicted output time of the frame in which the action will take effect.  This time is the operating system's best guess for when the rendered frame will start to appear on screen.

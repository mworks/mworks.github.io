EyeLink Tracker Setup
=====================

*Available on macOS*


Description
-----------
Prepare for calibration and launch the setup screen of an `EyeLink Device`.

Before launching the setup screen, this action sets the tracker's
gaze-position coordinate system (via EyeLink's ``screen_pixel_coords``
command) to match the coordinate system used on MWorks' main stimulus
display.  It then sets the calibration type (as specified in
`calibration_type`_), so that the tracker recomputes the positions of
fixation targets in the new coordinate system.

Once the EyeLink setup screen has been launched, the user can manually
initiate calibration, validation, or drift correction via the EyeLink host
PC.

This action can be executed only when the EyeLink device is *stopped* (i.e.
before the experiment invokes `Start IO Device` on it, or after it invokes
`Stop IO Device`).  Execution continues until the user manually exits the
setup screen on the EyeLink host PC.

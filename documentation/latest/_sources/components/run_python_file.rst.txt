.. _Run Python File:

Run Python File
===============


Description
-----------
Execute the specified file as `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ source
code.

.. rubric:: Available Modules and Functions

Python code executed by `Run Python File`, `Run Python String`, a `Python
File Resource`, or the `expression parser <Expressions>` functions
``py_eval`` and ``py_call`` can make use of both the `Python standard
library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html>`_ and `NumPy
<https://www.numpy.org>`_.  In addition, the following MWorks-specific
functions are available:

``getvar(name)``
    Returns the value of an MWorks variable.  ``name`` is a string
    containing the name of the variable.

``setvar(name, value)``
    Sets the value of an MWorks variable.  ``name`` is a string containing
    the name of the variable, and ``value`` is the new value to assign.

``getcodec()``
    Returns the code-to-name mapping for variables (as a dictionary).

``get_reverse_codec()``
    Returns the name-to-code mapping for variables (as a dictionary).

``register_event_callback(name, callback)``
    Registers an event callback function for an MWorks variable.  ``name``
    is a string containing the name of the variable, and ``callback`` is a
    Python function as described below.

``register_event_callback(code, callback)``
    Registers an event callback function for an MWorks variable.  ``code``
    is the integer code corresponding to the variable, and ``callback`` is a
    Python function as described below.

``register_event_callback(callback)``
    Registers an event callback function for *all* MWorks variables.
    ``callback`` is a Python function as described below.  (*Note*: The
    callback function will be invoked very, very frequently.  Use with
    caution!)

``unregister_event_callbacks()``
    Unregisters all event callback functions previously registered via
    Python code.

``message(msg)``
    Generates a normal MWorks message (like `Report / Message`).  ``msg``
    can be any value, which, after conversion to a string, is used as the
    text of the message.

``warning(msg)``
    Generates an MWorks warning message.  ``msg`` can be any value, which,
    after conversion to a string, is used as the text of the message.

``error(msg)``
    Generates an MWorks error message.  ``msg`` can be any value, which,
    after conversion to a string, is used as the text of the message.

Event callback functions are invoked whenever a value is assigned to the
variable of interest.  They receive a single argument of type ``Event``,
which has attributes ``code``, ``time``, and ``data``.  The values of
``code`` and ``time`` are always integers, while the value of ``data`` can
be a boolean, integer, float, string, list, or dictionary.

All MWorks-specific functions are pre-imported in to the ``__main__``
module, in which the user-provided Python file or string executes.  To use
them in other modules, import them from ``mworkscore``, e.g.

.. code:: python

    from mworkscore import getvar, setvar

.. rubric:: Execution Environment

All user-provided Python code is executed within Python's ``__main__``
module. This means that any variables, functions, classes, etc. defined by
one Python action or resource file are available to all subsequent ones.

Due to limitations in the Python interpreter, the Python environment is
*not* reset when a new experiment is loaded.  If your Python code expects to
run in a "clean slate" environment, it will have to perform the necessary
cleanup actions itself.

Also, event callback functions are never unregistered automatically.  They
must be removed explicitly via ``unregister_event_callbacks()``.

Rotary Speed Sensor
===================

*Available on macOS*


Description
-----------
Interface to a rotary speed sensor


Signature
---------
``iodevice/rotary_speed_sensor``


Required Parameters
-------------------

direction
^^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store the direction reported by the sensor.  The direction value is always 0 or 1.


rpm
^^^

Variable in which to store the rotational speed reported by the sensor. The rotational speed value is an integer ranging from 0 to 254 (inclusive) in units of revolutions per minute (RPM).




Optional Parameters
-------------------

serial_port
^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``/dev/cu.usbmodem23301``

Filesystem path that represents the serial port to which the rotary
speed sensor is connected.

If omitted, MWorks looks for a single, connected serial device.  If it
finds one, it assumes it to be the desired rotary speed sensor and
attempts to connect.


reconnect_interval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0``
:Example: ``10s``

If the rotary speed sensor disconnects unexpectedly (e.g. due to power
failure), and the value of this parameter is greater than zero, then
MWorks will attempt to reconnect at this interval.

For example, if this parameter is set to ``10s``, then, upon
disconnection, MWorks will wait for 10 seconds and then try to
reconnect.  If the reconnection attempt fails, MWorks will wait for
another 10 seconds, then try again, and so on.

If the value of this parameter is zero, MWorks will never attempt to
reconnect.


autostart
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the device will start I/O automatically (as if by an
implicit `Start IO Device` action) when the experiment starts running.

*Note*: Device I/O will always stop automatically when the experiment
stops running, irrespective of this setting.


alt
^^^

Alternative device to use if this one fails to initialize (e.g. because the required hardware is not available).  If ``#allowAltFailover`` is set to 0 or false, this parameter is ignored.

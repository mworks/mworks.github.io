LabJack LJM Analog Waveform Channel
===================================

*Available on macOS*


Description
-----------
Analog waveform channel on a `LabJack LJM Device`.

An analog waveform channel outputs a user-defined analog waveform on an
analog output (i.e. DAC) line.  Samples are output at the rate specified
by the device-level parameter ``analog_waveform_data_interval``.  All analog
waveform channels are started and stopped simultaneously, via the
`LabJack LJM Start Analog Waveform Output` and
`LabJack LJM Stop Analog Waveform Output` actions, respectively.



Signature
---------
``iochannel/labjack_ljm_analog_waveform``


Required Parameters
-------------------

line
^^^^
:Examples: | ``DAC0``
           | ``dac1``

Analog output line name

value
^^^^^
:Alias: data

Variable from which to read output voltage values (i.e. samples).  The
values are output at the rate specified by the
`device <LabJack LJM Device>`-level parameter
``analog_waveform_data_interval``.

The output values must be provided as either a list of numbers or as a
string containing the bytes of a double-precision floating-point array
in native byte order.  The latter format can be created, for example,
with the `tobytes method
<https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.tobytes.html>`_
of a `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ array.

The output values are read when
`LabJack LJM Start Analog Waveform Output` executes.  Therefore, they
can be changed at any time during the experiment, with the latest values
being read the next time waveform output is started.




Optional Parameters
-------------------

loop
^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the samples provided in `value`_ are output repeatedly in a
loop, producing a periodic waveform.  Otherwise, the samples are output
only once.

If the waveform does not loop, then once all the samples have been
output, the specified `line`_ will remain active with the value given
by the last sample until analog waveform output is `stopped <LabJack
LJM Stop Analog Waveform Output>`.  To make the output go to zero as
soon as the waveform ends, provide a value of zero for the last
sample.

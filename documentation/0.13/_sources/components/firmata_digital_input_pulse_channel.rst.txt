Firmata Digital Input Pulse Channel
===================================


Description
-----------
Digital input pulse channel on a `Firmata Device`.

A digital input pulse channel measures the duration of input "pulses" on its
associated pin.  Whenever the pin transitions to high/true, the Firmata
device records the pulse start time (as measured by its onboard clock). 
When the pin transitions back to low/false, the device subtracts the start
time from the current time and reports the elapsed duration to MWorks.

*Note*: Firmata devices always report pulse durations in milliseconds. 
MWorks converts these to microseconds before assigning them to `value`_.

QCUALOR Device
==============

*Available on macOS*


Description
-----------
Interface to a University of Washington Quad Channel Laser Modulator
(QCUALOR) device.

This component allows an MWorks experiment to configure the modulator and,
optionally, active/deactivate it.  See `meg_state`_ for more information.



Signature
---------
``iodevice/qcualor``


Optional Parameters
-------------------

serial_port
^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``/dev/cu.usbmodem11201``

Filesystem path that represents the serial port to which the QCUALOR
device is connected.

If omitted, MWorks looks for a single, connected serial device.  If it
finds one, it assumes it to be the desired QCUALOR device and attempts
to connect.


mode_1
^^^^^^
:Options: | ``continuous``
          | ``sinusoidal``
          | ``inverse_sinusoidal``
          | ``square``
          | ``off``
:Default: ``off``

Mode (i.e. waveform) for channel 1

mode_2
^^^^^^
:Default: ``off``

Mode (i.e. waveform) for channel 2.  Support the same options as `mode_1`_.


mode_3
^^^^^^
:Default: ``off``

Mode (i.e. waveform) for channel 3.  Support the same options as `mode_1`_.


mode_4
^^^^^^
:Default: ``off``

Mode (i.e. waveform) for channel 4.  Support the same options as `mode_1`_.


modulation_frequency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.5``

Modulation frequency (in hertz).  Must be between 0.5 and 500.

The modulator supports a fixed set of modulation frequencies, indexed by
integers ranging from 0 to 255.  MWorks converts the requested
frequency to an index via the following equation, where ``log`` is the
natural logarithm::

    index = round(255.0 * log(frequency / 0.5) / log(500.0 / 0.5))


gain_1
^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Gain (i.e. amplitude) for channel 1.  Must be between 0 and `max_gain`_.


gain_2
^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Gain (i.e. amplitude) for channel 2.  Must be between 0 and `max_gain`_.


gain_3
^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Gain (i.e. amplitude) for channel 3.  Must be between 0 and `max_gain`_.


gain_4
^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Gain (i.e. amplitude) for channel 4.  Must be between 0 and `max_gain`_.


max_gain
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.8``

Maximum allowed gain for each channel.  Must be between 0 and 1.


meg_state
^^^^^^^^^

Variable which is set to true by `Start IO Device` and false by `Stop IO
Device`.

If the same variable is used to set the state of a digital output line
(e.g. via a `DATAPixx Bit Output Channel`), and said output line is
connected to the QCUALOR device's Modulation Enable Gate (MEG), then
`Start IO Device` will configure and activate the modulator, and
`Stop IO Device` will deactivate it.

If this parameter is omitted, or if the assigned variable does *not*
control a digital output connected to the device's MEG input, then
`Start IO Device` will send the configuration commands to the
modulator, but the experiment must explicitly set the MEG state to high
to apply the configuration and activate the device.  Similarly, `Stop
IO Device` will send commmands to set all channel modes to "off" and
gains to zero, but the experiment must explicitly set the MEG state to
low to deactivate the modulator.


log_commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, log all commands sent to and responses received from the device to the MWorks event stream and server console


autostart
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the device will start I/O automatically (as if by an
implicit `Start IO Device` action) when the experiment starts running.

*Note*: Device I/O will always stop automatically when the experiment
stops running, irrespective of this setting.


alt
^^^

Alternative device to use if this one fails to initialize (e.g. because the required hardware is not available).  If ``#allowAltFailover`` is set to 0 or false, this parameter is ignored.

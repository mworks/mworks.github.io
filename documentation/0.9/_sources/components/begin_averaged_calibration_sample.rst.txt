Begin Averaged Calibration Sample
=================================


Description
-----------
Instruct a calibrator object to start computing an average of its input
value(s).

The purpose of this action is to allow the user to calibrate against a time
average over each of the input values, rather than against just the values
at a particular instant in time.  This action prompts the specified
calibrator to start averaging over its inputs.

The averaging must be stopped with either of the `End Averaged Calibration
Sample` or `End Averaged Calibration and Ignore` actions.  Thus, the total
time to average is at the user's discretion and is generally based on either
a sufficient time or the fact that another condition has arisen (e.g.
fixation broken for eye calibrators).

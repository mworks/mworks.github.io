Image Directory Movie Stimulus
==============================


Description
-----------
A movie stimulus that gets its frames from a directory of image files.

*Note*:  To preserve each image's aspect ratio on screen, `x_size`_ and
`y_size`_ must be equal.  When drawn, the larger dimension spans the full
specified size, while the smaller dimension is scaled to maintain the
aspect ratio.



Signature
---------
``stimulus/image_directory_movie``


Required Parameters
-------------------

directory_path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Filesystem path to the directory containing the image files.

*All* non-hidden files in this directory must be images.  The frames are
ordered according to the lexical sort order of the file names.


frames_per_second
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rate at which to display the movie's frames



Optional Parameters
-------------------

x_size
^^^^^^
:Example: ``5.0``

Horizontal size (degrees).

If omitted, the value of `y_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).


y_size
^^^^^^
:Example: ``5.0``

Vertical size (degrees).

If omitted, the value of `x_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).


x_position
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Horizontal center position (degrees)

y_position
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Vertical center position (degrees)

rotation
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Rotation (degrees)

alpha_multiplier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0``

Controls the transparency of the stimulus.  ``1.0`` is fully opaque, while ``0.0`` is fully tranparent.


fullscreen
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus is sized to fill the display.  In this mode, `x_size`_, `y_size`_, `x_position`_, `y_position`_, and `rotation`_ are ignored.


ended
^^^^^

Variable that will be set to true after the last frame has displayed. (Specifically, it will be set to true at the time that the next frame *after* the last would have been drawn, if there were one.)


loop
^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the presentation will repeat indefinitely (or until `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` is invoked)


repeats
^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0``

Number of times to repeat the presentation.  Note that the presentation
will always run at least once, even if this value is less than one.

If `loop`_ is ``YES``, this parameter is ignored.


deferred
^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``no``
          | ``yes``
          | ``explicit``
:Default: ``no``

Controls when the stimulus is loaded.  If ``no``, the stimulus is loaded at experiment load time.  If ``yes``, the stimulus is loaded the first time it is `queued <Queue Stimulus>`.  If ``explicit``, the stimulus must be loaded explictly with `Load Stimulus`.


autoplay
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus will start playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Play Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `queued <Queue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` has been invoked.  It will also stop playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `dequeued <Dequeue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` is invoked.

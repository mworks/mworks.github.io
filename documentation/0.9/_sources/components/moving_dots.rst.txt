.. _Moving Dots:

Moving Dots
===========


Description
-----------
A moving dot field stimulus


Signature
---------
``stimulus/moving_dots``


Required Parameters
-------------------

field_radius
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Field radius (degrees)

dot_density
^^^^^^^^^^^

Number of dots per square degree

dot_size
^^^^^^^^

Dot diameter (degrees)

speed
^^^^^

Dot speed (degrees per second)



Optional Parameters
-------------------

field_center_x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Field horizontal center position (degrees)

field_center_y
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Field vertical center position (degrees)

color
^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0,1.0,1.0``

Dot color, expressed as a comma-separated list of red, green, and blue components.  Each component may be described by any valid expression, but the expression must result in a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).


alpha_multiplier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0``

Controls the transparency of the dots.  ``1.0`` is fully opaque, while ``0.0`` is fully tranparent.


direction
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Direction of movement for coherent dots (degrees)

coherence
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0``

Fraction of dots that move in the specified `direction`_.  Non-coherent dots receive random directions.


lifetime
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Dot lifetime (seconds).  When a dot reaches the end of its lifetime, it is removed and replaced by a new dot in a random location.


announce_dots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, stimulus announcements (i.e. ``#announceStimulus`` and
``#stimDisplayUpdate`` events) will include dot positions.

Position data is encoded as a binary array of single-precision floating
point values (in platform `byte order
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness>`_), with each consecutive
pair of values representing the (x,y) coordinates of a dot.  The
coordinates are scaled to lie in the range [-1,1] and rotated so that
the direction of coherent motion is zero degrees.


rand_seed
^^^^^^^^^

Seed value for the random number generator.  If omitted, the current system time in nanoseconds is used.


deferred
^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``no``
          | ``yes``
          | ``explicit``
:Default: ``no``

Controls when the stimulus is loaded.  If ``no``, the stimulus is loaded at experiment load time.  If ``yes``, the stimulus is loaded the first time it is `queued <Queue Stimulus>`.  If ``explicit``, the stimulus must be loaded explictly with `Load Stimulus`.


autoplay
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus will start playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Play Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `queued <Queue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` has been invoked.  It will also stop playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `dequeued <Dequeue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` is invoked.

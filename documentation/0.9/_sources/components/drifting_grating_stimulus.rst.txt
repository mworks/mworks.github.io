Drifting Grating Stimulus
=========================


Description
-----------
A drifting grating stimulus


Signature
---------
``stimulus/drifting_grating``


Required Parameters
-------------------

spatial_frequency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``1``

Spatial frequency (cycles per degree)

speed
^^^^^
:Example: ``1``

Drift speed (degrees per second)

grating_type
^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``sinusoid``
          | ``square``
          | ``triangle``
          | ``sawtooth``

Grating type



Optional Parameters
-------------------

direction
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Direction of drift (degrees)

starting_phase
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Starting phase (degrees)

compute_phase_incrementally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``NO``, the current phase of the grating is computed from
`starting_phase`_, `spatial_frequency`_, `speed`_, and the total time
elapsed  since the stimulus started playing.

If ``YES``, the current phase is computed from the previous phase (i.e.
the phase when the stimulus was last drawn), `spatial_frequency`_,
`speed`_, and the time elapsed since the previous phase was computed.

This parameter is relevant only when the stimulus is `live queued <Live
Queue Stimulus>` and the values of `starting_phase`_,
`spatial_frequency`_, and/or `speed`_ are changed while the stimulus is
playing.  Most notably, if the parameter's value is ``NO``, then changes
to `speed`_ will cause a discontinuous jump in phase.  If the value is
``YES``, then changes to `speed`_ will be smooth, with no phase jump.


mask
^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the grating will function as a mask (similar to a `Mask
Stimulus`).  When used as part of a `layer <Layer Stimulus>`, "high"
regions of the grating (where the value is close to one) will allow
stimuli beneath it in the layer to show through, while "low" regions
(where the value is near zero) will partially or fully erase such
stimuli, exposing any stimuli beneath the layer.

When the value of this parameter is ``YES``, `color`_ and
`alpha_multiplier`_ are ignored.

*Note*: For compatibility with existing experiments, the value of this
parameter can also be one of ``rectangle``, ``ellipse``, or
``gaussian``, in which case it specifies the type of mask to apply to
the grating.  However, this usage is deprecated, and new experiments
should use a `Mask Stimulus` instead.


inverted
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, all grating values are inverted, e.g. high values become low, and low values become high


color
^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0,1.0,1.0``

The color of the stimulus, expressed as a comma-separated list of red, green, and blue components.  Each component may be described by any valid expression, but the expression must result in a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).


alpha_multiplier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0``

Controls the transparency of the stimulus.  ``1.0`` is fully opaque, while ``0.0`` is fully tranparent.


x_size
^^^^^^
:Example: ``5.0``

Horizontal size (degrees).

If omitted, the value of `y_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).


y_size
^^^^^^
:Example: ``5.0``

Vertical size (degrees).

If omitted, the value of `x_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).


x_position
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Horizontal center position (degrees)

y_position
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Vertical center position (degrees)

rotation
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Rotation (degrees)

fullscreen
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus is sized to fill the display.  In this mode, `x_size`_, `y_size`_, `x_position`_, `y_position`_, and `rotation`_ are ignored.


deferred
^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``no``
          | ``yes``
          | ``explicit``
:Default: ``no``

Controls when the stimulus is loaded.  If ``no``, the stimulus is loaded at experiment load time.  If ``yes``, the stimulus is loaded the first time it is `queued <Queue Stimulus>`.  If ``explicit``, the stimulus must be loaded explictly with `Load Stimulus`.


autoplay
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus will start playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Play Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `queued <Queue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` has been invoked.  It will also stop playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `dequeued <Dequeue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` is invoked.




Deprecated Parameters
---------------------

std_dev
^^^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0``

Standard deviation of Gaussian mask

mean
^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Mean of Gaussian mask.

This value determines the radial offset of the Gaussian peak from the
center of the grating.  If non-zero, the peak will be a circle, rather
than a point, and luminance will decrease both inside and outside the
circle, producing a toroidal stimulus.


normalized
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``YES``

If ``YES``, the Gaussian mask includes a multiplicative normalization term (``1/(std_dev*sqrt(2*pi))``).  If ``NO``, this term is omitted.

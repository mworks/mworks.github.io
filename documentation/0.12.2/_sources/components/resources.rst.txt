Resources
=========

Resource files (images, scripts, etc.) needed by an experiment.  At run
time, all resource files are copied, along with the experiment file itself,
to the system running MWServer.

*Note*:  In the absence of resource declarations, the MWorks parser
infers the required resources from the ``path`` and ``directory_path``
attributes of other components.  However, if the experiment declares
any resources, then this inference step is skipped.  Hence, an experiment
that declares any resources must include *all* required files in its
resource declarations.

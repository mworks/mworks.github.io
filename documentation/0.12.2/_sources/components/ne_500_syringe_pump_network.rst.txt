NE-500 Syringe Pump Network
===========================

*Available on macOS*


Description
-----------
Used for interfacing to a network of `NE-500 syringe pumps <http://www.syringepump.com/oem.php#aa>`_, accessed via a serial-to-ethernet bridge or a USB-to-serial adapter



Signature
---------
``iodevice/ne500``


Optional Parameters
-------------------

address
^^^^^^^
:Examples: | ``"10.0.254.254"``
           | ``/dev/cu.usbserial-FTH1RRH5``

If `port`_ is provided, the address is taken to be a host name,
and MWorks attempts to connect to the pump network via a
`TCP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol>`_
socket.  Otherwise, the address is assumed to be a filesystem path that
represents a serial port.

If neither address nor port is provided, MWorks looks for a single,
connected serial device.  If it finds one, it assumes it to be the
desired pump network and attempts to connect.


port
^^^^
:Example: ``100``

Port number for TCP connections

response_timeout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``100ms``

Maximum time to wait for responses to pump commands (microseconds).  If no response is received in the allotted time, issue an error message.


log_pump_commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``YES``

If ``YES``, log all commands sent to and responses received from the pump network to the MWorks event stream and server console


autostart
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the device will start I/O automatically (as if by an
implicit `Start IO Device` action) when the experiment starts running.

*Note*: Device I/O will always stop automatically when the experiment
stops running, irrespective of this setting.


alt
^^^

Alternative device to use if this one fails to initialize (e.g. because the required hardware is not available).  If ``#allowAltFailover`` is set to 0 or false, this parameter is ignored.

Image Directory Movie Stimulus
==============================


Description
-----------
A movie stimulus that gets its frames from a directory of image files.

*Note*:  In addition to the parameters described below, this stimulus also
accepts all the parameters of `Image Stimulus` (excluding ``path``).



Signature
---------
``stimulus/image_directory_movie``


Required Parameters
-------------------

directory_path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Filesystem path to the directory containing the image files.

*All* non-hidden files in this directory must be images.  The frames are
ordered according to the lexical sort order of the file names.


frames_per_second
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rate at which to display the movie's frames



Optional Parameters
-------------------

ended
^^^^^

Variable that will be set to true after the last frame has displayed. (Specifically, it will be set to true at the time that the next frame *after* the last would have been drawn, if there were one.)


loop
^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the presentation will repeat indefinitely (or until `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` is invoked)


repeats
^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0``

Number of times to repeat the presentation.  Note that the presentation
will always run at least once, even if this value is less than one.

If `loop`_ is ``YES``, this parameter is ignored.


deferred
^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``no``
          | ``yes``
          | ``explicit``
:Default: ``no``

Controls when the stimulus is loaded.  If ``no``, the stimulus is loaded at experiment load time.  If ``yes``, the stimulus is loaded the first time it is `queued <Queue Stimulus>`.  If ``explicit``, the stimulus must be loaded explictly with `Load Stimulus`.


autoplay
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus will start playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Play Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `queued <Queue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` has been invoked.  It will also stop playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `dequeued <Dequeue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` is invoked.

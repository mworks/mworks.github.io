Variable
========


Description
-----------
A general-purpose variable, used to store experiment parameters, collect results, and mediate the transfer of data between components



Signature
---------
``variable``

:Alias: ``var`` *(MWEL only)*


Required Parameters
-------------------

default_value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``0``

Initial value assigned to the variable when the experiment is loaded




Optional Parameters
-------------------

scope
^^^^^
:Options: | ``global``
          | ``local``
:Default: ``global``

Controls the visibility of changes made to the variable's value.

If a variable has local scope, then changes to its value are visible
only within the `paradigm component <Paradigm Components>` in which the
assignment was made.  These local changes persist between executions of
the paradigm component.

If a variable has global scope, changes to its value are visible
everywhere.


logging
^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``never``
          | ``when_changed``
:Default: ``when_changed``

Determines when the variable's value is written to the event stream (and thereby the data file)


persistant
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, then the variable's value is included in saved variable sets created via MWClient


exclude_from_data_file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, then the variable's value is *not* written to the data file. Other event stream listeners (e.g. MWClient, client- and server-side conduits) continue to receive its value.


groups
^^^^^^

Comma-separated list containing the names of groups to which the variable belongs.  Variable groups are displayed as expandable sections in MWClient's variables window.




Deprecated Parameters
---------------------

type
^^^^
:Options: | ``any``
          | ``boolean``
          | ``integer``
          | ``float``
          | ``string``
          | ``list``
:Default: ``any``

Controls how the content of `default_value`_ is interpreted.  When set to ``any`` (recommended), the default value is parsed like a normal expression, and the parser infers its type.

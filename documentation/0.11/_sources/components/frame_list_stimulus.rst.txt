Frame List Stimulus
===================


Description
-----------
A simple movie stimulus that presents its frames at the native refresh rate of the display.  The frames can be provided by a stimulus group or attached directly to the frame list as child components.



Signature
---------
``stimulus/frame_list``


Optional Parameters
-------------------

stimulus_group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stimulus group providing the frames

ending
^^^^^^

Variable that will be set to true when the frame list begins drawing its last frame (thereby notifying you of the optimal time to `queue <Queue Stimulus>`  stimuli that should be displayed during the frame *immediately following* said last frame)


ended
^^^^^

Variable that will be set to true after the last frame has displayed. (Specifically, it will be set to true at the time that the next frame *after* the last would have been drawn, if there were one.)


loop
^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the presentation will repeat indefinitely (or until `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` is invoked)


repeats
^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0``

Number of times to repeat the presentation.  Note that the presentation
will always run at least once, even if this value is less than one.

If `loop`_ is ``YES``, this parameter is ignored.


deferred
^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``no``
          | ``yes``
          | ``explicit``
:Default: ``no``

Controls when the stimulus is loaded.  If ``no``, the stimulus is loaded at experiment load time.  If ``yes``, the stimulus is loaded the first time it is `queued <Queue Stimulus>`.  If ``explicit``, the stimulus must be loaded explictly with `Load Stimulus`.


autoplay
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus will start playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Play Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `queued <Queue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` has been invoked.  It will also stop playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `dequeued <Dequeue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` is invoked.

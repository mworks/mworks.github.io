Protocol
========


Description
-----------
A top-level paradigm component that contains other sub-components.

Protocols are the largest unit of logical organization in an experiment.  To
"run" an experiment really means to run one or more of its protocols.

The execution order and number of repetitions of a protocol's sub-components
are determined by `selection`_, `nsamples`_, and `sampling_method`_.



Signature
---------
``protocol``


Optional Parameters
-------------------

interruptible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``YES``

If ``NO``, then any request to pause or stop the experiment while this component is executing will be deferred until said execution completes. This behavior is inherited by the component's children, making them non-interruptible as well.


selection
^^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``sequential``
          | ``sequential_ascending``
          | ``sequential_descending``
          | ``random_without_replacement``
          | ``random_with_replacement``
:Default: ``sequential``

Order in which to draw selections

nsamples
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``1``

Number of samples to allow before `Reset Selections` is required


sampling_method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``cycles``
          | ``samples``
:Default: ``cycles``

Controls the interpretation of `nsamples`_.  If set to ``cycles``, *all* possible selections must be made to complete one sample.  If set to ``samples``, each individual selection counts as a sample.

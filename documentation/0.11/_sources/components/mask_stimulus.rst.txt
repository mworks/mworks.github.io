Mask Stimulus
=============


Description
-----------
Masks are useful only in conjuction with `layers <Layer Stimulus>`.

A mask can truncate, obscure, or erase stimuli in its layer that lie below
it.  The "masked out" regions become transparent or semi-transparent
"windows", through which any stimuli below the layer are visible.  If the
mask is `inverted`_, it will make a "hole" through the stimuli under it,
allowing the stimuli beneath the layer to show through.

For example, the following layer will produce a red ring with inner radius
5 and outer radius 10::

    layer the_layer {
        circle (
            color = 1,0,0
            x_size = 20
            )
        mask (
            mask = ellipse
            inverted = true
            x_size = 10
            )
    }



Signature
---------
``stimulus/mask``


Required Parameters
-------------------

mask
^^^^
:Options: | ``rectangle``
          | ``ellipse``
          | ``gaussian``
          | ``raised_cosine``

Mask type



Optional Parameters
-------------------

inverted
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the effect of the mask is inverted: Areas of the display that normally would be visible through the mask are hidden, and areas that normally would be hidden are visible.


std_dev
^^^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0``

Standard deviation of Gaussian mask.

The Gaussian mask is computed on a 2x2 square, centered at the origin,
using the equation::

    exp(-1.0 * (dist - mean) * (dist - mean) / (2.0 * std_dev * std_dev))

where ``dist`` is distance from the center.  The mask is then stretched
to cover a rectangle of `x_size`_ by `y_size`_ degrees.  If the x and y
sizes are equal, then the mask is scaled by size/2 in both directions,
so std_dev has units of size/2 degrees.


mean
^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Mean of Gaussian mask.

This value determines the radial offset of the Gaussian peak from the
center of the mask.  If non-zero, the peak will be a circle, rather than
a point, and luminance will decrease both inside and outside the circle,
producing a toroidal mask.


normalized
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the Gaussian mask includes a multiplicative normalization term (``1/(std_dev*sqrt(2*pi))``).  If ``NO``, this term is omitted.


edge_width
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.125``

Edge width of raised cosine mask.

This value specifies the width of the sinusoidal edge as a fraction of
the total width (i.e. diameter) of the mask.  It should be greater than
zero and less than or equal to 0.5.


x_size
^^^^^^
:Example: ``5.0``

Horizontal size (degrees).

If omitted, the value of `y_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).


y_size
^^^^^^
:Example: ``5.0``

Vertical size (degrees).

If omitted, the value of `x_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).


x_position
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Horizontal center position (degrees)

y_position
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Vertical center position (degrees)

rotation
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Rotation (degrees)

fullscreen
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus is sized to fill the display.  In this mode, `x_size`_, `y_size`_, `x_position`_, `y_position`_, and `rotation`_ are ignored.


deferred
^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``no``
          | ``yes``
          | ``explicit``
:Default: ``no``

Controls when the stimulus is loaded.  If ``no``, the stimulus is loaded at experiment load time.  If ``yes``, the stimulus is loaded the first time it is `queued <Queue Stimulus>`.  If ``explicit``, the stimulus must be loaded explictly with `Load Stimulus`.

Assign Variable
===============


Description
-----------
Assign a value to a variable.

If the target variable's current value is a list or dictionary, you can
assign a new value to one of its elements by including one or more
square-bracket-enclosed indices in `variable`_.

In MWEL, `assignments <assignments>` are automatically converted into Assign
Variable actions (except for top-level assignments, which are converted into
`Variable Assignment` instances).

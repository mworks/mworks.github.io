XIMEA Camera Device
===================

*Available on macOS*


Description
-----------
Interface to a `XIMEA <https://www.ximea.com/>`_ camera.

MWorks configures the camera to capture 8-bit, grayscale images.  Each frame
capture is triggered by MWorks (i.e. software triggering).  In addition, the
output pin on the camera (OUT1 if there are multiple outputs) is configured
to be on during frame exposure.

Multiple cameras can be connected and used simultaneously, as long as
`serial_number`_ is specified for each device.



Signature
---------
``iodevice/ximea_camera``


Required Parameters
-------------------

exposure_time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``2ms``

Exposure time for each captured frame.  Must be greater than zero.


capture_interval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``33.33ms``

Interval between frame captures.  Must be greater than zero.


image_data
^^^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store captured frames.

The value assigned to the variable is a binary string containing a `JPEG
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG>`_-encoded image.  The time stamp of
the assignment is taken immediately after MWorks triggers the frame
capture.




Optional Parameters
-------------------

serial_number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``12345678``

Serial number of the desired camera.

If only one camera is connected, this parameter can be omitted, and
MWorks will connect to the one available device.


autostart
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the device will start I/O automatically (as if by an
implicit `Start IO Device` action) when the experiment starts running.

*Note*: Device I/O will always stop automatically when the experiment
stops running, irrespective of this setting.


alt
^^^

Alternative device to use if this one fails to initialize (e.g. because the required hardware is not available).  If ``#allowAltFailover`` is set to 0 or false, this parameter is ignored.

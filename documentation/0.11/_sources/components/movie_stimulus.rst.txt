Movie Stimulus
==============


Description
-----------
A simple movie stimulus that presents its frames at a specified frame rate.
The frames can be provided by a stimulus group or attached directly to the
movie as child components.

*Note*:  For compatibility with previous MWorks versions, this stimulus
ignores the `deferred`_ parameter.  Instead, the stimulus instance itself is
marked as loaded at creation (as if `deferred`_ were ``no``), but it does
not automatically load its frame stimuli (as if `deferred`_ were
``explicit``).  However, explicit `load <Load Stimulus>` and `unload <Unload
Stimulus>` actions *will* load/unload the frames along with the movie
stimulus itself.



Signature
---------
``stimulus/movie``


Required Parameters
-------------------

frames_per_second
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rate at which to display the movie's frames



Optional Parameters
-------------------

stimulus_group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stimulus group providing the frames

ended
^^^^^

Variable that will be set to true after the last frame has displayed. (Specifically, it will be set to true at the time that the next frame *after* the last would have been drawn, if there were one.)


loop
^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the presentation will repeat indefinitely (or until `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` is invoked)


repeats
^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0``

Number of times to repeat the presentation.  Note that the presentation
will always run at least once, even if this value is less than one.

If `loop`_ is ``YES``, this parameter is ignored.


deferred
^^^^^^^^
:Options: | ``no``
          | ``yes``
          | ``explicit``
:Default: ``no``

Controls when the stimulus is loaded.  If ``no``, the stimulus is loaded at experiment load time.  If ``yes``, the stimulus is loaded the first time it is `queued <Queue Stimulus>`.  If ``explicit``, the stimulus must be loaded explictly with `Load Stimulus`.


autoplay
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus will start playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Play Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `queued <Queue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` has been invoked.  It will also stop playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `dequeued <Dequeue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` is invoked.

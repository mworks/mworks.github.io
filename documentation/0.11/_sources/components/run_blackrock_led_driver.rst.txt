.. _Run Blackrock LED Driver:

Run Blackrock LED Driver
========================

*Available on macOS*


Description
-----------
Run a `Blackrock LED Driver` for the specified duration.  The desired
channel intensities must have been `set <Set Blackrock LED Driver Channel
Intensity>` previously.

If the duration or any channel intensities have changed since the last run,
the complete LED program must be sent to the driver before the presentation
can begin.  This transfer takes about 100ms to complete.  If this delay is
undesirable, you can force it to happen at an earlier, more convenient time
by invoking `Prepare Blackrock LED Driver` with the desired duration.  (Note
that you *must* pass the same duration to both "prepare" and "run", and you
*must not* change any channel intensities between them.  Otherwise, the LED
program will still need to be re-sent before the presentation begins.)
